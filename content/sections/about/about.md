I'm a Full Stack Developer with experience in building high-performing, responsive, beautiful web applications to deliver a unique, intuitive user experience that works.

I am a well-trained teammate who loves to share ideas and prioritizes communication in order to achieve goals within the set deadlines. I enjoy being challenged and working on projects that require me to step outside of my comfort zone, so my motto is <u>“Whatever comes up, I’ll figure it out!”</u>.
